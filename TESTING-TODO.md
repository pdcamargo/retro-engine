# Testing TODO — morning review queue

Autonomous build-loop output. One line per finished item; a HOW-to-test note when
it isn't obvious. Items here were verified by unit tests + a build-green gate but
could **not** be exercised via the retro-studio MCP (no path exists), so they need
a manual confirmation before their backlog/roadmap entries are considered closed.

---

## Input system — Phase 1 (keyboard + mouse) · `@retro-engine/input` · ADR-0144

- **What changed:** New `@retro-engine/input` package: `ButtonInput<T>` / `Axis<T>`
  primitives; `KeyboardInput`, `MouseButtonInput`, `MouseMotion`, `MouseScroll`,
  `CursorPosition` resources; an `InputBackend` HAL (`DomInputBackend` +
  `HeadlessInputBackend`); `InputPlugin` (opt-in, headless-safe, `preUpdate`
  clear-then-drain lifecycle). Wired into the playground as `?mode=input`.
- **Automated:** 30 unit tests (button/axis/frame-lifecycle/backend-selection) green;
  lint/typecheck/test/build/bench all green. A per-frame bench (`applyInputFrame`)
  joined the suite (`packages/input/bench`, added to `bench:check`).
- **Why no MCP verification:** input needs real key/mouse events; the retro-studio
  MCP has no key-injection tool, and synthetic canvas events don't drive jsimgui.
  So this is unit-tested + manual.
- **HOW to test (manual):** run the playground (`cd apps/playground && bun run dev`),
  open `http://localhost:<port>/?mode=input`, click the canvas to focus it, then:
  - **WASD / arrow keys** move the white square; **release** stops it.
  - **Space** snaps it back to the origin.
  - **Hold left mouse button** → the square tints cyan; release → white.
  - **Mouse wheel** scales the square (0.4×–4×).
  - Live state is on `window.__input` (`{x, y, scale, pressed, cursor}`) — check it
    in the dev console to confirm resources update without eyeballing pixels.
- **Not deleted:** `docs/roadmap/input-system.md` stays (Phases 2–5 remain: action
  map + reflection, gamepad, touch, studio binding editor). `MASTER-ROADMAP.md`
  Input box left unchecked until the full AC (gamepad/touch/action-map) lands.

---

## Input system — Phase 2 (action map) · `@retro-engine/input` · ADR-0145

- **What changed:** Component-based action layer (leafwing-shaped). `ActionMap`
  (authored, reflection-registered, serialized) + `ActionState` (derived,
  auto-attached, not serialized). Fluent builder (`.button`/`.axis`/`.axis2d`) with
  `key()`/`mouseButton()` sources; per-frame resolver runs in `preUpdate` after the
  raw device update. Playground `?mode=input` now drives the sprite through the
  action map and rebinds `Reset` at runtime.
- **Automated:** +10 unit tests (builder, resolve semantics for button/axis/axis2d,
  many-to-many, reflection round-trip via `TypeRegistry`) — 40 input tests green;
  a `resolveActionState` bench joined the suite; full repo gate green.
- **Why no MCP verification:** same as Phase 1 — no key-injection path.
- **HOW to test (manual):** playground `?mode=input`, focus the canvas:
  - **WASD / arrow keys** move the square (via the `Move` / `MoveArrows` axis2d).
  - **Space** resets to origin (the `Reset` action). Press **R** to rebind Reset to
    **Enter** (then Enter resets, Space doesn't); press **R** again to swap back —
    `window.__input.resetKey` shows the current binding.
  - **F or left mouse** tints the square (the `Fire` action).
  - `window.__input` also exposes `{move:{x,y}, fire}` resolved from the action map.
- **Reflection check:** the `ActionMap` schema round-trips (unit test), so bindings
  will survive a scene save once the studio persists this component.

---

## Input system — Phase 3 (gamepad) · `@retro-engine/input` · ADR-0146

- **What changed:** Poll-based gamepad support. `GamepadSource` (`NavigatorGamepadSource`
  + `HeadlessGamepadSource`), `Gamepads` resource keyed by pad index with per-pad
  `ButtonInput<GamepadButton>` + `Axis<GamepadAxis>`, W3C Standard-Gamepad mapping
  (named buttons/axes; stick-Y flipped so up=+1; triggers as [0,1] axes), configurable
  dead zone, connect/disconnect via poll reconciliation. Polled in `preUpdate`.
- **Automated:** +11 unit tests (dead zone, connect/read, button edges, triggers,
  disconnect lifecycle, non-standard raw access, multi-pad) — 50 input tests green;
  an `updateGamepads` bench joined the suite; full repo gate green.
- **Why no MCP verification:** no gamepad-injection path (and no physical pad in CI).
- **HOW to test (manual):** plug in an Xbox/PS controller, open playground `?mode=input`,
  press any button on the pad once (browsers only expose a gamepad after first input),
  then: **left stick** moves the square; **A / ✕ (South)** tints it. `window.__input.gamepad`
  shows `{connected, x, y, south}`. If you have no controller, this phase is covered by
  the unit tests only — the `Gamepads` API is driven by a scriptable `GamepadSource`.
- **Follow-up (not done):** gamepad bindings in the action map (rebindable gamepad) —
  logged as a new MASTER-ROADMAP item.

---

## Input system — Phase 4 (touch) · `@retro-engine/input` · ADR-0144

- **What changed:** `Touches` resource of active `TouchPoint`s (id, position,
  start position, per-frame delta, phase) with a `ButtonInput`-style lifecycle
  (`justStarted`/`justEnded`, `iter`/`first`/`count`). DOM backend emits
  touchstart/move/end/cancel; folded into the same `preUpdate` frame step.
- **Automated:** +3 unit tests (start→move→end lifecycle, multi-touch, cancel) —
  53 input tests green; touch events added to the `applyInputFrame` bench; full gate green.
- **Why no MCP verification:** no touch-injection path.
- **HOW to test (manual):** playground `?mode=input`, open browser devtools and
  enable **touch/device emulation**, then drag on the canvas — `window.__input.touches`
  shows `{count, x, y}` for the primary touch. Without a touch device this is covered
  by the unit tests (a scriptable `QueueBackend` feeds touch events).

---

## Audio system — Phase 1 (HAL + Web Audio + AudioClip) · `@retro-engine/audio` · ADR-0147

- **What changed:** New `@retro-engine/audio` package. `AudioBackend` HAL +
  `WebAudioBackend` (AudioContext, lazy decode cache, per-voice source→gain→master,
  autoplay-resume) + `NullAudioBackend`; `AudioClip` asset (encoded bytes) + importer +
  `.meta` kind on wav/ogg/mp3; `Audio` resource facade (play/stop/volume/pitch/loop,
  one-shot + looping); `AudioPlugin` (opt-in, headless-safe). Playground `?mode=audio`.
- **Automated:** 6 unit tests (importer defensive-copy, NullAudioBackend, `Audio` facade
  routing incl. handle resolution) green; lint/typecheck/test/build green. No bench (no
  headless-benchable per-frame path yet; Phase 2's `AudioSource` sync will carry one).
- **Why no MCP verification:** audio needs a real `AudioContext` + speakers; no MCP path,
  and headless bun has no Web Audio (unit tests use a mock/null backend).
- **HOW to test (manual):** playground `?mode=audio`, **click the canvas once** (browsers
  keep audio suspended until a gesture — the backend resumes on that click), then:
  - **Space / left-click** → a short beep at a random pitch (one-shot; overlapping plays OK).
  - **M** → toggle a looping low tone (music); M again stops it.
  - `window.__audio` shows `{ suspended, oneShots, looping }`.
- **Not deleted:** `docs/roadmap/audio.md` stays (Phase 2 ECS components + mixer buses remain).
  MASTER-ROADMAP Audio box left unchecked until Phase 2 (`AudioSource`/`AudioListener` + sample).

---

## Audio system — Phase 2 (ECS playback) · `@retro-engine/audio` · ADR-0147

- **What changed:** Component-driven audio. `AudioSource` (clip handle, volume, pitch,
  loop, playOnAdd, despawnOnEnd, play()/stop()) + `AudioListener` (master volume),
  reflection-registered; `AudioVoices` runtime resource; `reconcileAudio` playback
  system in postUpdate (playOnAdd retry-until-loaded, explicit play/stop, live volume
  sync, despawn/drop finished one-shots, stop-on-removal). Listener → master gain.
- **Automated:** +9 unit tests (playOnAdd + retry, play/stop, volume sync, despawnOnEnd,
  loop-never-finishes, stop-on-removal) — 15 audio tests green; `reconcileAudio` bench
  joined the suite; full repo gate green.
- **Why no MCP verification:** same as Phase 1 — needs a real AudioContext + speakers.
- **HOW to test (manual):** playground `?mode=audio`, click the canvas once (resumes audio),
  then: looping **music** starts automatically (an `AudioSource` entity); **Space / left-click**
  spawns a one-shot beep entity that despawns itself when done (`despawnOnEnd`); **M** toggles
  the music (source.play()/stop()). `window.__audio` shows `{ oneShots, musicPlaying, voices }`
  (voices = live `AudioVoices.size`).

---

## Physics — Phase 1 (physics-core contract + components) · `@retro-engine/physics-core` · ADR-0148

- **What changed:** New `@retro-engine/physics-core` package. `PhysicsBackend` interface +
  `PhysicsCapabilities` + `NullPhysicsBackend`; Avian-shaped `2d`/`3d` components (RigidBody,
  Collider, Linear/Angular velocity, ExternalForce, Restitution/Friction/GravityScale/Sensor),
  reflection-registered; `Gravity` + `Physics` resources; `PhysicsPlugin` runs the
  Sync→Step→Writeback bridge in the fixed timestep (no-op until a backend is injected).
- **Automated:** 16 unit tests (component factories, bridge snapshot/writeback/collider-desc/
  angle, null backend, reflection round-trip incl. vec2/vec3/enum) green; a snapshot bench joined
  the suite; full repo gate green.
- **Why not verified in the studio yet:** nothing moves without a backend — real behavior arrives
  in Phase 2 (physics-rapier). Phase 1 is contract + components, unit-tested.
- **HOW to test (manual, later):** nothing visible yet — Phase 2 will add a `?mode=physics`
  playground demo (boxes fall + land). For now: `bun test` in packages/physics-core is green, and
  the components will appear in the studio Add-Component list once a project loads the plugin.
- **Not deleted:** `docs/roadmap/physics.md` stays (Phase 2 rapier backend + Phase 3 3D/character/
  joints/events remain). MASTER-ROADMAP Physics box left unchecked until real simulation ships.

---

## Physics — Phase 2 (Rapier 2D backend) · `@retro-engine/physics-rapier` · ADR-0148

- **What changed:** New `@retro-engine/physics-rapier` package: `createRapierBackend()` over
  `@dimforge/rapier2d-compat` — real 2D dynamics implementing the full `PhysicsBackend` contract
  (async wasm gate, entity↔body maps, upsert/step/readBody/remove, gravity/gravity-scale/
  external-force/kinematic, raycast, collision-event drain). Playground `?mode=physics` demo.
- **Automated (REAL verification):** 4 deterministic bun tests using the actual Rapier wasm —
  a dynamic box falls under gravity and lands on a static floor (y: 5 → ~1.0), gravityScale 0
  floats, removeBody drops the body, 3D snapshots ignored. This is genuine physics verification,
  not just a compile. Full repo gate green (41 typecheck / 23 lint / 40 test / build).
- **HOW to test (manual, visual):** run the playground (`cd apps/playground && bun run dev`), open
  `?mode=physics`, click the canvas: 5 colored boxes fall and **stack on the grey floor**; press
  **Space** to drop more from the top (random x). `window.__physics` shows `{ready, boxes, lowestY}`.
- **Not deleted:** `docs/roadmap/physics.md` stays. MASTER-ROADMAP Physics box still unchecked —
  Phase 3 (3D via rapier3d-compat, kinematic character controller, joints, ECS collision events)
  remains for the full P0 AC.

---

## Physics — 3D backend · `@retro-engine/physics-rapier` · ADR-0148

- **What changed:** `createRapierBackend()` is now dimension-aware — internal `world-2d.ts` +
  `world-3d.ts` adapters (rapier2d-compat / rapier3d-compat), routed by snapshot dimension;
  `capabilities.dimensions3d = true`. 3D: Vec3 translation, quaternion rotation, Vec3 angular
  velocity, cuboid(hx,hy,hz)/ball/capsule.
- **Automated (REAL):** 5 deterministic bun tests on the actual wasm — a 3D box falls + lands
  on a floor (rotation is a quaternion), and a mixed scene runs 2D + 3D bodies independently.
  Full repo gate green.
- **HOW to test (manual):** the 2D `?mode=physics` demo is unchanged (still uses the 2D path);
  a dedicated 3D visual demo (Camera3d + meshes) will land with the character-controller phase.
  The 3D backend itself is proven by the deterministic tests.
- **Remaining for the Physics box:** kinematic character controller, joints, and collision
  events surfaced to ECS (a message channel).

---

## Physics — collision events → ECS · `@retro-engine/physics-core` + `physics-rapier` · ADR-0148

- **What changed:** `CollisionEvent` is now an ECS message class; `PhysicsPlugin` writes the
  backend's drained start/stop events each fixed step. Rapier colliders now enable
  `ActiveEvents.COLLISION_EVENTS` (they're silent otherwise). Read via `MessageReader(CollisionEvent)`.
- **Automated (REAL):** a headless bun test drops a box on the floor and asserts a `started`
  collision event is emitted between the two entities. 6 rapier tests green; full gate green.
- **HOW to test (in a game):** add a system with `MessageReader(CollisionEvent)`; each `{kind:'started'
  |'stopped', a, b}` reports a contact between entity `a` and `b`. (Manual: wire it into a scene and
  log hits; not visually verifiable on its own.)
- **Remaining for the Physics box:** kinematic character controller + joints (+ a moving-character demo).

---

## Physics — kinematic character controller · `physics-core` + `physics-rapier` · ADR-0148

- **What changed:** `CharacterController2d`/`3d` components (offset, slope limits, autostep,
  snap-to-ground, `desiredTranslation` input, `grounded` output) + `PhysicsBackend.moveCharacter`.
  The Rapier backend drives a per-entity `KinematicCharacterController` (2D + 3D); the bridge moves
  the character by the collision-corrected amount each fixed step and writes back `grounded`.
- **Automated (REAL):** 8 rapier tests — a kinematic character walks along a floor and stays grounded,
  and is stopped by a wall (collide-and-slide). Full repo gate green.
- **HOW to use (game):** spawn an entity with `Transform` + `RigidBody2d.kinematic()` +
  `Collider2d.capsule(...)` + `new CharacterController2d({ snapToGroundDistance: 0.5 })`; each frame set
  `cc.desiredTranslation` (e.g. from input + gravity) and read `cc.grounded`.
- **Remaining for the Physics box:** joints (fixed/revolute/…).

---

## Physics — joints · `physics-core` + `physics-rapier` · ADR-0148

- **What changed:** `Joint2d` (fixed/revolute/prismatic) + `Joint3d` (+spherical) components (target
  entity, local anchors, axis; reflection-registered) + `PhysicsBackend.upsertJoint`/`removeJoint`
  over Rapier `ImpulseJoint`. The bridge creates joints once both bodies exist, removes on component
  removal / body despawn. `capabilities.joints = true`.
- **Automated (REAL):** headless test — a fixed joint holds a dynamic body against gravity; removing
  the joint lets it fall. 9 rapier tests green; full gate green.
- **HOW to test (in a game / studio):** attach `new Joint2d(otherEntity, 'fixed', { localAnchorB: [...] })`
  to a body; the two bodies stay constrained. (Manual visual demo pending studio physics gizmos.)

---

## ✅ P0 Physics item COMPLETE — box checked in MASTER-ROADMAP

The **Physics** P0 item is fully done: `physics-core` contract + Avian components (reflection) +
`physics-rapier` **2D & 3D** backend with real dynamics, collision events → ECS, a kinematic
character controller, and joints — all with deterministic headless tests. Playground `?mode=physics`
demos falling/stacking boxes + a walking character (Space drops more; A/D or arrows move the character).
Reference tag ✅. Studio integration (collider gizmos / debug draw / inspector) moved to P1.
**Three P0 items now complete: Input, Audio, Physics.** Next P0: Engine text (MSDF) or the two
stabilization bug fixes.

---

## Fix — malformed material uniform no longer freezes the render loop · `engine` · bug

- **What changed:** (1) `StandardMaterial` validates/pads `baseColor`/`emissive` at construction (short
  → padded from default, e.g. `emissive:[1,1,1]`→`[1,1,1,0]`; non-array/non-number → throws clearly).
  (2) `MaterialPlugin.prepareMaterials` wraps each material's uniform pack in try/catch — a throwing
  material is logged once and skipped, the rest of the scene keeps rendering.
- **Automated:** unit tests — constructor padding/rejection (standard-material.test.ts) + a deliberately
  malformed material is skipped while a good one still prepares (material-plugin.test.ts). Full gate green.
- **Why bug file kept:** verified by unit tests, not the studio MCP — so per the loop rule I left
  `docs/bugs/malformed-material-uniform-breaks-render-loop.md` for you to confirm & delete. The
  MASTER-ROADMAP box is checked (fix shipped + unit-verified).
- **HOW to confirm (manual, optional):** in the studio, set a `StandardMaterial.emissive` to a
  3-component value via `studio.eval` / a hand-edited `.remat` → the viewport keeps rendering (a dev
  warning is logged; the bad material is skipped) instead of freezing.

---

## Fix — mesh missing a required attribute no longer freezes the renderer · `engine` · bug

- **What changed:** `MaterialPlugin` checks (before building a pipeline) that a mesh's vertex layout
  provides every attribute the material requires (`Material.requiredMeshAttributes()`, default
  POSITION/NORMAL/UV_0). A mesh missing one has its draw skipped + one dev warning, instead of an
  invalid pipeline poisoning the frame encoder and freezing the viewport. Guards the mesh + skinned
  queue paths.
- **Automated:** `missingMeshAttributes` unit tests (missing UV / missing normal / full mesh). The
  actual GPU freeze can't be reproduced with the stub renderer (it doesn't validate pipelines), so the
  guard's *decision* is unit-tested; the end-to-end freeze-avoidance is by construction (skip before
  pipeline build). Also fixed a test fixture (`buildCube`) that was a UV-less mesh only "working"
  because the stub skips validation. Full gate green (1154 engine tests).
- **Why bug file kept:** unit-test-only verification (no MCP freeze-repro path) — left
  `docs/bugs/mesh-without-uv-freezes-renderer.md` for you to confirm & delete. MASTER-ROADMAP box checked.
- **HOW to confirm (manual, optional):** in the studio, add a mesh/glTF whose vertex data omits UVs and
  assign a `StandardMaterial` → the viewport keeps rendering (that mesh is skipped + a dev warning logged)
  instead of freezing.

---

## ✅ Both P0 stabilization bugs fixed — Input, Audio, Physics + both freezers = P0 progressing fast

Four P0 items + both stabilization freezers now done. Remaining P0: Engine text (MSDF), In-game UI
(depends on text), Play mode, Web export.

---

## ✅ P0 Audio item COMPLETE — box checked in MASTER-ROADMAP

The **Audio (core)** P0 item is fully done (HAL + Web Audio backend + `AudioClip` +
`AudioSource`/`AudioListener` + reflection + entity SFX/music sample; headless-safe).
Reference tag flipped to ✅. Mixer buses / spatial panning / studio audio preview are P1/P2.
Next P0 target: **Physics** (or Engine text / in-game UI).

---

## ✅ P0 Input item COMPLETE — box checked in MASTER-ROADMAP

The **Input system** P0 item is fully done (keyboard + mouse + action map + gamepad +
touch; headless-safe; reflection; sample). Reference tag flipped to ✅. Remaining input
work (gamepad-in-action-map, touch gestures, studio binding editor) moved to **P1**.
Next P0 target: **Audio (core)**.

---

## 🟡 Engine text (MSDF) — Phase 1 shipped (data + layout engine, pure)

The MSDF text system's algorithmic core landed under `packages/engine/src/text/`:
`MsdfFont`/`parseMsdfFont` (parses `msdf-atlas-gen` JSON, throws on malformed) and
`layoutText`/`measureText` (advances, kerning, `\n`, greedy word wrap at `maxWidth`,
left/center/right alignment, top-left-origin atlas UVs). **Pure logic — no GPU, no
component yet**, so verified by unit tests only (no MCP/editor path exists at this phase).

- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/engine/src/text/` — 19 tests cover parsing,
  whitespace glyphs, kerning, wrapping/overflow, alignment, newlines, top/bottom atlas
  y-origin, and measure↔layout agreement.
- **Not yet visible in the studio.** Rendering (a `Font` asset kind + `.meta`, the
  `Text2d` component, the MSDF shader, glyph-quad batching through the 2D pipeline, and a
  `?mode=text` sample) is Phase 2 — that's when there'll be an on-screen thing to look at.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/text-rendering.md`; decision: ADR-0149. MASTER-ROADMAP item
  marked 🟡 (box stays unchecked until Phase 2 renders text).

---

## 🟡 Engine text (MSDF) — Phase 2a shipped (Font asset + Text2d component)

The asset + component layer of MSDF text landed under `packages/engine/src/text/`:
`Font` (parsed `MsdfFont` + atlas `Handle<Image>`), `Fonts` store, `createFontImporter`
(parses a `.font` msdf-atlas-gen descriptor, decodes its companion atlas into a **linear**
image sub-asset — sibling `<base>.png` by default, or a top-level `"image"` override),
the `Text2d` component (text/font/size/color/align/lineHeight/maxWidth/letterSpacing/anchor,
reflection-registered), and `TextPlugin`. **Still no rendering** — no MSDF shader/batching
yet, and `TextPlugin` is deliberately not in the default plugin set. Verified by unit tests
only (no MCP path until Phase 2b draws pixels).

- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/engine/src/text/` — 29 tests: importer (fake
  decoder + fake load-context; linear atlas, sibling derivation, `"image"` override,
  missing-sibling + malformed rejection), Text2d defaults, and a full scene
  serialize→deserialize round-trip of every Text2d field incl. the font handle GUID.
- **Not yet visible in the studio.** Phase 2b (MSDF WGSL shader, glyph-quad batching
  through the 2D pipeline, `?mode=text` sample, wiring TextPlugin into DefaultPlugins) is
  the next slice — that's when there's an on-screen thing to screenshot.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/text-rendering.md` (Phase 2 split into 2a done / 2b next).
  Decision: ADR-0149. MASTER-ROADMAP item stays 🟡 until Phase 2b renders text.

---

## 🟡 Engine text (MSDF) — Phase 2b shipped (glyph render pipeline)

`TextPlugin` now actually renders `Text2d`. Added the `retro_engine::text` MSDF shader
(median-of-RGB distance + screen-px-range AA), `TextPipeline` (specialized on render-target
shape, always alpha-blended), `TextInstanceBuffer`, `packGlyphInstance` (block-local y-down
glyph → world-space quad honoring the entity transform + pivot, per-glyph atlas UV +
`unitRange`), and the `text-prepare` (after `image-prepare`) + `text-queue` render systems
(one instanced transparent draw per text entity).

- **HOW to test now:** `bun test packages/engine/src/text/` — 39 tests, incl. a
  capturing-renderer integration test asserting the transparent2d pass gets one instanced
  draw per text entity, correct instance counts (1 per visible glyph), per-entity batching,
  the atlas bound at `@group(1)`, and skip behavior (no font / whitespace-only → no draw).
  Bench: `bun run --cwd packages/engine bench --filter "text prepare"` (~65µs / 400 glyphs).
- **Still not visible on screen** — no committed font atlas yet, and `TextPlugin` isn't
  added by any sample/studio scene. Phase 2c commits a real `msdf-atlas-gen` font (.font +
  .png), adds a `?mode=text` playground scene, and wires TextPlugin alongside SpritePlugin —
  that's when there's an actual on-window screenshot to verify via the studio MCP.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/text-rendering.md` (Phase 2 → 2a/2b done, 2c next). ADR-0149.
  MASTER-ROADMAP stays 🟡 until text is drawn on screen and MCP-verified.

---

## 🟡 Engine text (MSDF) — Phase 2c shipped (built-in SDF default font + ?mode=text sample)

No native `msdf-atlas-gen` is installed and headless bun can't rasterize system fonts, so
rather than block, I shipped a **pure-JS SDF font generator** (`generateSdfFont`) and a
**built-in default font** (`installDefaultFont`) — monoline stroke glyphs (uppercase, digits,
punctuation; lowercase aliased to uppercase) rasterized to a single-channel SDF the
median-of-RGB shader consumes unchanged. Zero external deps, zero committed binaries. Added a
`?mode=text` playground scene (title / multi-line / wrapped / right-aligned HUD / spinner).

- **HOW to test (headless):** `bun test packages/engine/src/text/` — 47 tests incl. SDF
  gradient/metrics/atlas checks and a capturing-renderer test drawing "HELLO" with the built-in
  font (5 instances).
- **HOW to test (visual — needs a WebGPU browser):** run the playground and open
  `?mode=text` → five text blocks in different sizes/colors/alignments + a spinning "SPIN!".
  Confirm glyphs are crisp when the window is resized/zoomed (SDF scale-independence) and the
  spinner's glyphs rotate with the entity.
- **Studio:** 2D render plugins are project-declared (like SpritePlugin), so open a studio
  project that adds `TextPlugin` + a `Text2d` entity to see text in the editor. Couldn't
  MCP-verify this session (studio relay disconnected — `studio_connected` = false).
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/text-rendering.md` (Phases 1–2c done). ADR-0149. MASTER-ROADMAP item
  stays 🟡 until visual confirmation + Phase 3 (world-space Text). A true multi-channel MSDF
  atlas via `msdf-atlas-gen` is an optional tooling upgrade — the `.font` importer already
  loads one; the built-in SDF font is the no-tooling default.

### Tooling note (not a hard blocker)
`msdf-atlas-gen` / `msdfgen` are not installed on this machine (checked `which` + brew + npm).
The engine ships a pure-JS SDF font instead, so text works without them. Installing
`msdf-atlas-gen` later would enable authoring true multi-channel MSDF fonts (sharper corners)
that load through the existing `.font` importer.

---

## 🟡 In-game UI (Retro CSS) — Phase 1a shipped (flexbox LayoutEngine)

New package `@retro-engine/ui` with the pure layout foundation: a `LayoutEngine` interface
+ `FlexLayoutEngine` — single-line CSS flexbox (main-axis grow/shrink with min/max clamping +
iterative freezing per §9.7, `justify-content`, `align-items`/`align-self`, `gap`,
padding/margin, `position: absolute` insets) with a text-measure callback hook, plus
`UiStyle`/`makeStyle`. Pure TS, no ECS/GPU.

- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/ui/` — 21 tests (row/column, grow/shrink + min clamp,
  all justify-content modes, align stretch/center/end + align-self, gap, padding/margin,
  row-reverse, measure callback, absolute insets incl. left+right stretch, nested trees).
  Bench: `bun run --cwd packages/ui bench` (~51µs for a 271-node grid).
- **Not yet in the ECS or on screen.** Phase 1b adds `UiNode`/`ComputedLayout` + a `UiPlugin`
  layout system (walk hierarchy → run engine → write layout); Phase 2 renders through the 2D
  pipeline (quads + ADR-0149 glyphs); Phase 3 `.rss` styling; Phase 4 widgets. So nothing to
  screenshot yet — the layout math is verified purely.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (rewritten to the retained-ECS + flexbox + `.rss`
  model). Decision: ADR-0150. MASTER-ROADMAP item is 🟡 (box stays unchecked until the UI
  renders styled widgets on screen).

---

## 🟡 In-game UI — Phase 1b shipped (UiNode/ComputedLayout + UiPlugin layout system)

The flexbox engine now runs from the ECS. Added `UiNode` (authored `UiStyle`,
reflection-registered — auto/no-max encoded as omitted `undefined`, so it round-trips),
`ComputedLayout` (derived absolute screen-space rect, not serialized, auto-attached via
required components), and `UiPlugin` — a `postUpdate` `ui-layout` system that mirrors the
`Parent`/`Children` hierarchy into a LayoutNode tree, runs the engine, and writes each
entity's `ComputedLayout` with accumulated absolute coordinates. `UiViewport` (root size) +
`UiLayout` (swappable engine) resources.

- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/ui/` — 29 tests. Phase 1b covers: ComputedLayout
  auto-attach, a flex-row hierarchy → absolute rects, auto-root fills viewport, ancestor
  offset accumulation (nested padding), a UiNode under a non-UI parent treated as a root,
  and a full UiNode reflection round-trip of every authored style field.
- **Still not on screen.** Phase 2 renders the computed boxes (quads + borders + ADR-0149
  glyphs) through the 2D pipeline and wires `measureText` for text content nodes; Phase 3 is
  `.rss` styling; Phase 4 widgets. So nothing to screenshot yet — layout is verified purely
  in the ECS.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (Phases 1a+1b done). ADR-0150. MASTER-ROADMAP 🟡.

## 🟡 Web export — Phase 1 shipped (.rpak asset package format)

New package `@retro-engine/build` with the deployable asset-delivery format (the foundation
the web target streams from). `.rpak` v1: magic+version header → JSON TOC (guid/offset/length/
codec/uncompressedLength/hash) → concatenated per-entry blobs. `writeRpak` (build-time, gzip
via Web Streams with a node:zlib fallback, FNV-1a content hashes), `RpakReader` (in-memory,
by GUID), `RangeRpakReader` (lazy — open() reads only header+TOC, each read() fetches only
that asset's byte range via an injected RangeFetch → HTTP-Range streaming), and the
`ExportTarget`/`ExportRegistry` interface. Reader layer is browser-safe.

- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/build/` — 13 tests: write→read round-trip (none + gzip
  codecs), magic/version validation, duplicate-GUID + missing-GUID rejection, gzip actually
  compresses + round-trips, corrupt-blob integrity failure, and a RangeRpakReader test proving
  open() does exactly header+TOC fetches and read() fetches only one entry's range (never the
  whole archive). Bench: `bun run --cwd packages/build bench`.
- **This is a fully headless, self-contained P0 slice** (no GPU/studio needed). Remaining for
  the Web export item: the Bun bundler for user code + the web adapter (emit index.html +
  engine + user bundle + write the project's assets into a .rpak) + a real project exporting
  and running in a browser — those need a browser to fully confirm.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/web-build-target.md`. Decision: ADR-0151. MASTER-ROADMAP 🟡.

---

## 🟡 Web export — Phase 2 shipped (web adapter: bundler + index.html + .rpak)

`@retro-engine/build` now turns a project into a deployable static site.
`bundleUserCode` (typed Bun-bundler wrapper — browser/ESM, externals/minify/sourcemap),
`emitIndexHtml` (pure boot page: full-viewport canvas + module script + optional .rpak
preload), and `WebExportTarget` (the 'web' ExportTarget: bundle the entry → write bundle +
index.html → pack assets into assets.rpak → return the file list).

- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/build/` — 19 tests. Phase 2: bundleUserCode bundles a
  browser ESM fixture leaving externals bare; WebExportTarget exports a fixture end-to-end
  (asserts index.html + main.js + assets.rpak on disk, index.html references both, and the
  packed .rpak reads back through RpakReader); no-assets case skips the archive + preload.
- **Remaining for the Web export P0 check-off** (not headlessly verifiable here): a `retro
  build --target web` CLI, the studio "Build → Web" menu, and the actual in-browser run of a
  real exported project (needs a WebGPU browser). The pipeline that PRODUCES the artifact is
  done + verified; the "it runs in a browser" proof needs eyes on a browser.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/web-build-target.md`. Decision: ADR-0151. MASTER-ROADMAP 🟡.

## 🟡 Play mode — snapshot/restore core shipped (editor-sdk)

Play mode's revert mechanism now exists in `@retro-engine/editor-sdk` (ADR-0152).
`captureSnapshot(world, registry, keep)` serializes the authored entities (excluding
editor-infra via the `keep` filter); `restoreSnapshot(...)` despawns current authored
entities and respawns the snapshot, returning the snapshot-id → new-Entity map. App
conveniences (`capturePlaySnapshot`/`restorePlaySnapshot` via serializeWorld/spawnScene)
and `installPlayModeSnapshot(app, { keep, onRestore })` wire capture to `onExit(SimState.Edit)`
and restore to `onEnter(SimState.Edit)`. Gating policy formalized: user systems run only
`inState(Play)`. Entity-only revert in v1 (resources persist).

- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/editor-sdk/src/play-snapshot.test.ts` — 4 tests
  (World-level, no renderer): capture excludes editor-tagged entities; restore reverts
  play-time edits/spawns/despawns exactly; editor-infra entities survive untouched;
  idempotent across repeated capture/restore cycles.
- **Not yet wired into the studio.** Remaining (needs the studio + MCP to verify): call
  `installPlayModeSnapshot(app, { keep: e => !world.has(e, EditorOnly), onRestore: remapSelection })`
  in the studio boot; remap `state.selectedEntity` through the returned id map; make the
  inspector reflect the restored state; and wire the toolbar **Step** button (advance one
  frame while Paused). Backlog `docs/backlog/studio-playmode-snapshot-restore.md` kept until
  the studio integration is confirmed via MCP.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/play-mode.md`. Decision: ADR-0152. MASTER-ROADMAP 🟡.

---

## 🟡 In-game UI — Phase 3 (.rss parser + style resolution) shipped

`@retro-engine/ui` can now author styling as a `.rss` (USS/CSS-subset) stylesheet resolved to
`UiStyle`. `parseRss` (comments, comma lists, compound type/`#name`/`.class`/`:state`/`*`
selectors) + `matches`/`specificity` + `resolveDeclarations` (specificity → source-order
cascade) + `resolveUiStyle` (declaration→UiStyle: flex/box-model/alignment, px/auto lengths,
padding/margin shorthands, inline overrides win). Pure + headless.

- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/ui/` — 41 tests. Phase 3: selector parsing, specificity
  ordering, cascade (higher specificity wins; ties → later rule), declaration mapping + edge
  shorthands, inline overrides, and an end-to-end parse→resolve→layout assertion.
- **Not yet wired into the runtime.** Remaining (3b): descendant/child combinators, `--var`/
  `var()` custom properties + inheritance, and wiring resolution into the `UiPlugin` layout
  pass (a `.rss` asset kind + `Stylesheet` resource + state-marker components). Rendering (2)
  + widgets (4) still pending; both need the studio/GPU to see on screen.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (Phase 3 🟡). ADR-0150. MASTER-ROADMAP 🟡.

---

## ✅ Web export — runtime host + `retro build` CLI + in-browser run proof (VERIFIED via browser)

The web export can now turn a project into a static site that **actually boots in a browser**.
New `@retro-engine/runtime-web` (`bootWebGame`: canvas → WebGPU renderer → add project plugins →
run — ADR-0153); `emitWebBoot` + `WebExportTarget` bundle a generated boot entry so `main.js`
boots the game; `parseProjectDescriptor` (in `@retro-engine/project`) reads `project.retroengine`;
`runWebExport` + a `retro-build` CLI drive the export. New asset-free `@retro-engine/sample-game`
(2D camera + MSDF `Text2d`) is the smoke test.

- **Verified end-to-end (Playwright, not just unit tests):** `retro build --project apps/sample-game`
  → static site → loaded in a real browser → WebGPU initialized, "RETRO ENGINE" / "WEB EXPORT OK"
  rendered crisply, and the "SPIN!" label was caught mid-rotation (frame loop runs). This doubles as
  the on-screen confirmation of the MSDF text pipeline (built-in default font).
- **Automated:** runtime-web 7 tests, project descriptor 3, build web-boot/run-export/web-export
  suites green; full monorepo gate green (lint/typecheck/test/build/bench). Changeset added.
- **HOW to re-test manually:**
  1. `bun run packages/build/src/cli.ts --project apps/sample-game --out /tmp/dist-web`
  2. Serve it: `cd /tmp/dist-web && bunx serve` (or any static server) and open the URL in a
     WebGPU browser (Chrome/Edge/Safari TP). You should see the three text lines with a spinning
     "SPIN!". (Needs a WebGPU adapter — headless environments without a GPU won't render.)
- **Not fully done (Export P0 stays unchecked):** studio "Build → Web" menu; packing `assets/`
  into the `.rpak` (assets aren't bundled yet); source maps / prod polish; tree-shaking jsimgui out
  of the shipped bundle (it's currently ~5 MB, mostly the editor-only imgui pulled in transitively).
  Logged as "Export — Web follow-ups" in MASTER-ROADMAP.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/web-build-target.md`. ADRs 0151 + 0153. MASTER-ROADMAP Export item 🟡.

## 🟡 In-game UI — Phase 1c: UiText + measureText bridge (unit-tested)

`@retro-engine/ui` can now size a UI node to its text. New `UiText` component (authored,
reflection-registered: text/font/fontSize/letterSpacing/lineHeight; requires `UiNode`) +
`makeTextMeasure(uiText, fonts)` builds the flex `MeasureFunc` from the engine text layer
(`Font.measure`, ADR-0149). `UiPlugin` threads the `Fonts` store into the layout pass and
attaches the measure func to leaf text nodes, so flexbox sizes text intrinsically (wrapping
to the offered width). Graceful when no `Fonts` store is present (nodes size by style). This
is the ADR-0149 `measureText` measure-callback wiring the UI layout was waiting on.

- **Automated:** 53 UI tests (was 41) — UiText defaults/overrides/reflection round-trip,
  makeTextMeasure guards (empty/no-font/unloaded) + option passing (fontSize/letterSpacing
  always; lineHeight/maxWidth conditional) + result mapping, and two integration tests (a
  UiText leaf sizes to its measured text in a flex row; stays style-sized with no font store).
  Full repo gate green (lint/typecheck/test/build/bench). Changeset added.
- **Why no MCP verification:** UI still has no on-screen rendering (Phase 2) — layout/measure
  is headless. It'll be visually verifiable once UI Phase 2 rendering lands (drivable via the
  same sample-game web-export → Playwright path used for text).
- **HOW to test:** `bun test packages/ui/`. Behavior: a `UiText` on a `UiNode` leaf gets an
  intrinsic size from its font so a flex container lays it out like a real label.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (Phase 1c ✅) + `text-rendering.md` (Phase 3 measure
  bridge ✅). ADR-0149/0150. MASTER-ROADMAP UI + Text items updated.

---

## ✅ In-game UI — Phase 2a: screen-space rendering (VERIFIED via browser)

In-game UI now renders on screen. New `UiRenderPlugin` (`@retro-engine/ui`, ADR-0154)
composites `UiNode` `backgroundColor` fills over the rendered scene via a once-per-frame
screen-space overlay render-graph node (`UiPassNode`, `loadOp:'load'`, ordered after the
camera driver — owns its own encoder, draws camera-free clip-space quads). `UiStyle` gains
`backgroundColor` (Vec4); `UiPipeline` is an alpha-blended quad pipeline with no bind groups
(clip mapping done on CPU). Nodes paint in the layout's depth-first `ComputedLayout.order` so
children draw over their (possibly translucent) parent.

- **Verified end-to-end (Playwright, real browser):** the `sample-game` web export now draws
  a bottom-right flex HUD panel — a translucent panel containing an orange title bar (fixed
  height) + a green content area (flexGrow) — correctly nested and composited over the text
  scene. Confirms overlay pass, flex layout → clip quads, alpha blend, nesting order, and
  screen-space anchoring.
- **Automated:** 60 UI tests (computeClipRect/packUiColor/packUiQuad + existing); `ui-quad-pack`
  bench (512 nodes ~1.6µs); full repo gate green (lint/typecheck/test/build/bench). Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** `bun run packages/build/src/cli.ts --project apps/sample-game --out /tmp/dw`
  then serve `/tmp/dw` and open in a WebGPU browser → HUD panel bottom-right over the text.
- **Not done (UI P0 stays unchecked):** borders + corner radius; **in-UI text** (2b, via the
  ADR-0149 glyph path — the measure bridge exists but text isn't drawn inside UI yet); z-index/
  clipping; `.rss` runtime wiring (3b); widgets (4). Logged in MASTER-ROADMAP.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (Phase 2a ✅). ADR-0150/0154. MASTER-ROADMAP UI item 🟡.

---

## ✅ In-game UI — Phase 2b: in-UI text rendering (VERIFIED via browser)

`UiText` nodes now draw glyphs on screen, positioned within the node's content box and
composited over UI backgrounds. New `UiTextPipeline` — a screen-space MSDF glyph pipeline
(ADR-0154) reusing the engine's glyph layout (`Font.layout`) + font atlas (unit quad +
per-instance clip rect + atlas UV + unitRange + unorm8x4 color; median-of-RGB coverage with
fwidth AA). `prepareUiText` lays out each label, places glyphs at the content origin, maps to
clip space, packs grouped per atlas. `UiTextPassNode` (a second overlay node after the quad
pass) draws the batches with per-atlas bind groups. `UiText.color` added.

- **Verified end-to-end (Playwright, real browser):** the `sample-game` export HUD panel now
  shows "STATUS" (dark on the orange title bar) + "HP 100  MP 42" (white on the green content
  area), crisp, inside their content boxes, layered over the quads — confirms glyph pipeline,
  content-box positioning, per-node color, and pass ordering (text over backgrounds).
- **Automated:** 61 UI tests (+ packUiGlyph); `ui-text-pack` bench (1024 glyphs ~3.4µs); full
  repo gate green (lint/typecheck/test/build/bench). Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** same as 2a (`retro build` the sample, serve, open) → HUD panel bottom-right
  now has text labels.
- **Not done (UI P0 stays unchecked):** borders + corner radius; per-line text alignment;
  z-index/clipping + interleaved text-vs-later-panel ordering; `.rss` runtime wiring (3b);
  **widgets** (4 — button/label/slider + picking/focus + a menu sample). Logged in MASTER-ROADMAP.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (Phase 2b ✅). ADR-0150/0154. MASTER-ROADMAP UI item 🟡.

---

## ✅ In-game UI — Phase 4a: pointer interaction (VERIFIED via browser)

UI nodes respond to the pointer — the foundation for buttons/menus. `Interactable` marker
(opts a node into picking; auto-attaches UiNode/ComputedLayout/UiInteraction), `UiInteraction`
state (`none`/`hovered`/`pressed`, derived), `UiClicked` message (press-begins-and-releases on
the same node). `pickTopmost` hit-tests front-most by paint order; `updateUiInteraction` is the
per-frame hover/press/click state machine; `UiInteractionPlugin` runs it in preUpdate after the
input update, reading CursorPosition + MouseButtonInput (`@retro-engine/input` is now a ui dep).
Headless/no-input → no-op.

- **Verified end-to-end (Playwright, real browser):** the `sample-game` export now has a centered
  "CLICK ME" button that tints on hover/press and a "CLICKS: N" label that increments per click.
  Drove real DOM mousedown/mouseup at the button center via the input backend → picking →
  UiClicked → counter: fresh load = 0, one click → 1, next click → 2 (exact, no spurious counts).
- **Automated:** 69 UI tests (pickTopmost + full hover/press/click state machine incl. release-
  outside + cursor-absent); `ui-picking` bench; full repo gate green. Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** export the sample, serve, open in a WebGPU browser → move over the centered
  "CLICK ME" (it lightens), click it (counter increments; darkens while held).
- **Not done (UI P0 stays unchecked):** widget components (button/label/slider) + keyboard/gamepad
  focus routing + a menu sample (4b); borders/radius; `.rss` runtime wiring (3b). Logged in MASTER-ROADMAP.
- **Minor API friction noted:** the resolved `UiStyle` is fully readonly, so runtime style changes
  (e.g. hover tint) need a cast; consider a mutable style-patch helper. (Follow-up, not blocking.)
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (Phase 4a ✅). ADR-0150/0154. MASTER-ROADMAP UI item 🟡.

---

## ✅ In-game UI — Phase 4b: UiButton widget + Disabled (VERIFIED via browser)

Ergonomic buttons on the interaction layer. `UiButton` holds a normal/hovered/pressed/disabled
background palette; a built-in `UiInteractionPlugin` system tints the node from it by its
`UiInteraction` state (games no longer hand-write hover/press tinting). `Disabled` marker: picking
skips it (no hover/press/click) and it shows the disabled color. `setUiBackground(node, color)` is
the supported runtime recolor (resolved UiStyle is otherwise readonly). `pickTopmost`/
`updateUiInteraction` skip disabled entries.

- **Verified end-to-end (Playwright, real browser):** the `sample-game` export renders a centered
  3-button MAIN MENU — NEW GAME / LOAD (disabled, greyed) / QUIT — with built-in button styling.
  Driving real DOM clicks at each button's reported screen center: NEW GAME → LAST:NEW GAME,
  QUIT → LAST:QUIT, and the disabled LOAD button leaves LAST unchanged. Per-button routing via a
  `MenuAction` component resolved from the `UiClicked` entity.
- **Automated:** 74 UI tests (disabled-picking + UiButton palette/requires); full repo gate green
  (lint/typecheck/test/build/bench). Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** export the sample, serve, open in a WebGPU browser → centered menu; hover a
  button (lightens), click it (LAST label updates); the greyed LOAD button ignores clicks.
- **Not done (UI P0 stays unchecked):** more widgets (label/toggle/slider/text-input) + focus/
  spatial nav (4c); borders/radius + z-index; `.rss` runtime wiring (3b). Logged in MASTER-ROADMAP.
- **Font note:** the built-in default font is uppercase-only and lacks `()`, so "LOAD (SOON)"
  renders as "LOAD SOON" — cosmetic, not a bug (a real font asset would cover it).
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (Phase 4b ✅). ADR-0150/0154. MASTER-ROADMAP UI item 🟡.

---

## ✅ In-game UI — Phase 2c: node borders (VERIFIED via browser)

UI nodes can draw a border. `UiStyle` gains `borderWidth` (per-side Edges, same scalar/partial
shorthand as padding/margin) + `borderColor` (Vec4), both reflection-registered. The overlay
prepare pass emits up to four inset edge quads per node (CSS border-box; corners not double-
covered), painted over the node's background and behind its children via the existing depth-first
order — reuses the UI quad pipeline (no new pipeline). `borderEdgeRects` is the pure edge helper.

- **Verified end-to-end (Playwright, real browser):** the `sample-game` export's bottom-right HUD
  panel and all three MAIN MENU buttons now render light border outlines.
- **Automated:** 77 UI tests (borderEdgeRects geometry: uniform/zero/single-side); full repo gate
  green. Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** export the sample, serve, open → panel + menu buttons have outlines.
- **Also:** promoted the big remaining Export gap (asset `.rpak` delivery) to a phased plan in
  `docs/roadmap/web-build-target.md` (scanner → runtime RpakAssetSource → sprite proof) for a
  future focused effort — exported games currently load no project assets.
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap/ui-system.md` (Phase 2c ✅). ADR-0150/0154. MASTER-ROADMAP UI item 🟡.

---

## 🟡 Export — web asset packing, phase A (build/unit-verified)

`retro build` now packs a project's assets into the export. `scanProjectAssets` (@retro-engine/build)
walks the project's `.meta` sidecars (skipping node_modules/dist/.re/.git/.turbo), parses each
({guid, kind}; location = sidecar path minus `.meta`), reads the asset bytes, and returns a baked
AssetManifestFile + GUID-keyed RpakInput[]. `WebExportTarget` writes `manifest.json` beside the
bundle; `runWebExport` runs the scan + packs. New `@retro-engine/assets` dep on build.

- **Verified (build + unit, no MCP path — runtime doesn't load assets yet):** added a sample asset
  (`apps/sample-game/assets/credits.txt` + `.meta`); `retro build` now emits `assets.rpak` + `manifest.json`
  alongside main.js/index.html; the packed asset reads back by GUID through `RpakReader` and the manifest
  parses (checked via a scratch script + a run-export test asserting both outputs + a manifest entry).
- **Automated:** build 29 tests (parseMetaEntry parse/strip/malformed; scanProjectAssets over a fixture with
  orphan + excluded-dir; run-export asserts manifest.json + assets.rpak). Full repo gate green. Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** `bun run packages/build/src/cli.ts --project apps/sample-game --out /tmp/dw` → `/tmp/dw`
  contains assets.rpak + manifest.json; read a GUID back via RpakReader.
- **Not done (Export P0 stays unchecked):** phase B — a browser `RpakAssetSource` wired into the App's
  `AssetServer` so exported games actually LOAD packed assets; phase C — a sprite-from-.rpak browser proof;
  studio "Build → Web" menu. Plan in `docs/roadmap/web-build-target.md`.
- Roadmap: `web-build-target.md` (asset phase A ✅). ADR-0151/0153. MASTER-ROADMAP Export item 🟡.

---

## 🟡 Export — web asset delivery, phase B: runtime .rpak source (browser + unit-verified)

Exported games can now load their packed assets. `RpakAssetSource` (@retro-engine/runtime-web) is an
AssetSource that reads from a `.rpak` by GUID, resolving the AssetServer's location-based read through
the project manifest (location→GUID), opening the archive lazily then streaming per-entry byte ranges.
`httpRangeFetch` does HTTP Range (robust to non-Range 200 servers — slices locally). `bootWebGame({
assets: { rpakUrl, manifestUrl } })` fetches the manifest, adds AssetPlugin({source}), and setManifests —
before the game's plugins. New browser-safe `@retro-engine/build/rpak` subpath lets the browser runtime
import the reader without the node-only export pipeline; `emitWebBoot`/`WebExportTarget` forward the URLs.

- **Verified (browser + unit):** the sample-game export bundles the reader for the browser (node:zlib
  fallback externalized) and boots — `bootWebGame` fetched `manifest.json`, wired the source, and set
  `window.__retroAssets = { entries: 1 }` in-browser; the served `.rpak` parses (TOC has the GUID). The
  `RpakAssetSource.read` path is unit-tested end-to-end over a real `writeRpak` archive + fake RangeFetch
  (runtime-web 10 tests). Full repo gate green. Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** export the sample, serve, open in a WebGPU browser + devtools → `window.__retroAssets`
  shows `{ entries: 1 }`; `fetch('assets.rpak')` returns the archive.
- **Not done (Export P0 stays unchecked):** phase C — a real image loads by GUID from the `.rpak` and
  renders as a Sprite in the browser (needs an image loader + a Sprite consumer in the sample), which
  exercises an actual per-asset read end-to-end; studio "Build → Web" menu. Plan in web-build-target.md.
- Roadmap: `web-build-target.md` (asset phase B ✅). ADR-0151/0153. MASTER-ROADMAP Export item 🟡.

---

## ✅ Export — web asset delivery, phase C: end-to-end packed-asset load (VERIFIED via browser)

The exported game now actually LOADS + consumes a packed asset. The `sample-game` packs
`assets/credits.txt`; at runtime it registers a tiny text loader (`bytes → string`), `loadByGuid`s
the credits GUID, and a system consumes the value once the async load drains into the store,
showing "CREDITS: LOADED" and setting `window.__game.credits`.

- **Verified end-to-end (Playwright, real browser):** `window.__game.credits` equals the exact
  `credits.txt` content — proving the full path: build packs it → bootWebGame fetches manifest +
  wires RpakAssetSource → loadByGuid → RpakAssetSource.read (location→GUID) → RangeRpakReader over
  HTTP → decode → store → game code consumes it. The UI label updates to "CREDITS: LOADED".
- **Automated:** app-only change (no packages/*/src) so no changeset; full repo gate green. The
  underlying source/reader are unit-tested (phase B).
- **HOW to test:** export the sample, serve, open in a WebGPU browser + devtools → `window.__game.credits`
  is the credits text; the on-screen "CREDITS: LOADED" label confirms the consume.
- **Export asset delivery A+B+C is complete + browser-verified.** Remaining for the Export P0
  check-off: the studio "Build → Web" menu (studio-side) + source-map/prod polish.
- Roadmap: `web-build-target.md` (asset phase C ✅). MASTER-ROADMAP Export item 🟡 (studio menu remains).

---

## ✅ Play mode — snapshot/restore wired into the studio (VERIFIED via studio MCP)

The studio's Play→Stop now reverts the scene. `installPlayModeSnapshot` is installed in
`apps/studio/src/main.ts` (`keep = !EditorOnly`): Play captures the authored scene, Stop despawns
authored entities + respawns the snapshot. Fixed a real bug found via MCP: `capturePlaySnapshot`
was capturing glTF-instantiated children verbatim, so restore's `spawnScene` re-instantiated them
→ every Play/Stop **doubled** a model's node tree. Now composition-aware: engine
`SerializeOptions.composition` → `serializeWorld` → `collectComposition`; `capturePlaySnapshot`
passes the App's `CompositionRegistry` (entities-only, per ADR-0152). Selection clears on restore.

- **Verified end-to-end (studio + retro-studio MCP, real `retro-game-sample` project):** brought up
  `bun tauri dev` (Rust pre-built → ~6s), drove `studio_play` → `component_set Health.current`
  → `studio_stop`. Before the fix: Stop left Health at 150 (not reverted) AND the hierarchy had TWO
  `Armature`/`Character_*` subtrees. After the fix: Hero's Health reverts 150→110, and a play/stop
  cycle keeps the entity count at 77→77 (no duplication) — screenshots `playmode-before/after`.
- **Automated:** engine (37 scene tests) + editor-sdk (64 tests) green; full repo gate green. Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** open the studio on a project with a glTF model, select an entity, press Play,
  change a field, press Stop → the field reverts and the model isn't duplicated.
- **Backlog LEFT (not deleted):** `docs/backlog/studio-playmode-snapshot-restore.md` — acceptance
  criterion "selection *survives* the round-trip" is only partially met (selection is safely CLEARED,
  not remapped to a persistent identity). Also **Step** (advance one frame while Paused — the ▶⏭
  toolbar button is still inert) + inspector-during-play remain. Please confirm before I delete it.
- **Separately confirmed the P1 bug** `studio-mcp-component-set-entity-and-vec3`: `component_set`
  on a vec3 field (`Transform.translation = [5,5,5]`) corrupted it to `[]` live — reproduced via MCP.
- Roadmap: `play-mode.md` + MASTER-ROADMAP Play-mode item + `reference/studio-editor.md` updated. ADR-0152.

---

## ✅ Play mode — Step: advance one frame while paused (VERIFIED via studio MCP)

The dead ▶⏭ toolbar Step button now works, and there's a new `studio.step` MCP command.
Stepping advances gameplay **exactly one frame while `Paused`, without leaving the paused state**.

- **Design:** new `SimStep` resource + `installSimStep(app)` (`@retro-engine/editor-sdk`,
  `sim-step.ts`) run a `'first'`-stage system that opens a one-frame `active` window when a step is
  queued. The studio composes the project play gate as `inState(SimState.Play).or(simStepActive())`
  (`main.ts`), so gameplay runs while playing *or* for one stepped frame. `requestSimStep` is a
  no-op unless paused (meaningless in Edit / already-running Play). Because `SimState` never changes
  during a step, `state.playing`/`paused` mirrors and the inspector's play-mode behavior don't churn.
- **Verified end-to-end (studio + retro-studio MCP, real `retro-game-sample`):** brought up
  `bun tauri dev`, `studio_play` → `studio_pause`, `component_set Health.current = 40`. Confirmed
  Health stayed **40 across many frames while paused** (gameplay frozen). Then `studio_step` → **41**;
  read again (no step) → still **41** (the step was exactly one frame); two more steps → **42 → 43**
  (linear, regen is +1/frame). `simState` stayed **"Paused"** throughout (no flicker). `studio_step`
  in Edit returned `{stepped:false}` (guard works). Stop still restored Health 43→110 (snapshot intact).
- **Automated:** `packages/editor-sdk/src/sim-step.test.ts` (2 frame-driven tests, App+`advanceFrame`):
  freezes while paused, advances exactly one frame per step, stays frozen after, no-op unless paused,
  and in Play a step adds no extra frame. Full repo gate green (typecheck/lint/test). Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** open the studio, press Play, then Pause. Change a gameplay-driven value (or set
  `Health.current` low) → it stays put. Click the ⏭ Step button (or run `studio.step`) → gameplay
  advances one frame each click.
- **New gap logged** (MASTER-ROADMAP + play-mode.md): fixed-timestep + Step — a stepped frame could
  run *accumulated* `fixedUpdate` steps as a catch-up burst (mirrors ordinary pause→resume); latent
  today (sample has no `fixedUpdate` gameplay). Fix later by freezing the fixed accumulator while not playing.
- Docs: `reference/studio-editor.md` (Step ✅, MCP 66→67 tools), `roadmap/play-mode.md` (Step ✅),
  MASTER-ROADMAP Play-mode AC (Step ✅; inspector-during-play + selection-survival still ❌).

## ✅ In-game UI — `.rss` runtime style wiring ("Retro CSS") (VERIFIED via browser export)

The `.rss` parser + cascade existed but weren't applied to the running UI. Now a parsed
stylesheet styles live nodes each frame, including pseudo-class states.

- **New in `@retro-engine/ui`:** `resolveUiStyle` now maps paint props
  (`background-color`/`border-color`/`border-width` + `border` shorthand) via a CSS
  `parseColor` (hex 3/4/6/8-digit, `rgb()`/`rgba()`, named → `[0,1]` `Vec4`). A `UiStyleSheet`
  resource holds active rules (`setUiStyleSheet(app, rss)`); a `UiClass` component
  (reflection-registered: `classes`/`name`/`type`) is a node's selector identity; a `postUpdate`
  `'ui-style'` system (before `'ui-layout'`) resolves each `UiClass` node's style from the sheet
  every frame, deriving states — `hovered`/`pressed` from `UiInteraction`, `disabled` from the
  `Disabled` marker. Nodes without a `UiClass` are untouched (keep authored style).
- **Verified end-to-end in a real browser** (`apps/sample-game` web export → Playwright): added a
  top-left chip strip styled ONLY by `.rss` (no inline UiStyle) + a probe reporting each chip's
  resolved fill. Read back: `.chip` → `rgb(40,120,210)`, `.chip.alt` (compound selector) →
  `rgb(240,150,40)` (beat the base rule), chips sized/bordered from the sheet. Then dispatched a
  `mousemove` over the interactive `.chip.hot` chip → its resolved fill flipped to `rgb(240,60,60)`
  (the `.chip:hovered` rule) within a frame — proving live state-driven re-resolution.
- **Automated:** `packages/ui/src/rss-style.test.ts` (9 tests: color parsing, paint mapping,
  ECS resolution, `:hovered`/`:disabled` states, `#name`/type selectors, unmatched → default) +
  `packages/ui/bench/rss-style.bench.ts`. Full repo gate green (1935 tests). Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** `cd apps/sample-game && bun run build:web`, serve `dist/web`, open in a browser
  → three chips top-left (blue, orange, blue); hover the third → it turns red.
- Docs: `roadmap/ui-system.md` Phase 3b ✅, MASTER-ROADMAP In-game UI item prose. (UI item stays
  unchecked — corner-radius/z-index/clipping, more widgets (4c), combinators/`--vars`/inheritance,
  and a `.rss` asset kind remain.)

## ✅ In-game UI — `.rss` custom properties (`--vars` / `var()`) + runtime theme (VERIFIED via browser export)

Extends "Retro CSS" with CSS custom properties and a runtime-overridable theme — closes the
`--vars via a theme resource` UI acceptance-criterion.

- **New in `@retro-engine/ui`:** `collectThemeVars(rules)` (gather `--name` declarations into a flat
  theme, later-wins) + `substituteVars(value, vars)` (`var(--name)` / `var(--name, fallback)`);
  `resolveUiStyle` gained a `vars` arg (substitutes before mapping; auto-collects sheet vars when
  none passed). New `UiTheme` resource + `setUiThemeVars(app, vars)` — overrides merged over the
  sheet's `--vars`, re-themed live by the `'ui-style'` system each pass. Also fixed the `border`
  shorthand to accept functional colors (`rgb(r, g, b)` with internal spaces), not just hex.
- **Verified end-to-end in a real browser** (`apps/sample-game` export → Playwright): the sample
  `.rss` now defines `:root { --accent … --alt … --hot … }` and the chips fill via `var(--accent)` /
  `var(--alt)`. Read back: plain chip = `rgb(40,120,210)`, alt chip = `rgb(240,150,40)`. Then called
  `window.__setAccent('rgb(0,200,0)')` (→ `setUiThemeVars`) → the accent chips recolored to
  `rgb(0,200,0)` within a frame, while the `.alt` chip (uses `var(--alt)`) stayed orange — proving
  runtime re-theming is targeted per-variable.
- **Automated:** `packages/ui/src/rss-style.test.ts` (now 14 tests: + var collection/substitution,
  sheet-var resolution, theme override, functional-color border) + updated `rss-style` bench (vars).
  Full repo gate green (1940 tests). Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** `cd apps/sample-game && bun run build:web`, serve `dist/web`, open in a browser →
  blue + orange + blue chips top-left; in the console run `window.__setAccent('rgb(0,200,0)')` → the
  first and third chips turn green, the middle (alt) stays orange.
- Docs: `roadmap/ui-system.md` Phase 3c ✅, MASTER-ROADMAP UI item (AC `--vars` ✅; remaining widget
  gap = **image** + `.rss` inheritance). UI item stays unchecked.

## ✅ In-game UI — image widget (`UiImage`, textured UI quads) (VERIFIED via browser export)

Adds the `image` minimal widget (panel/label/button/**image** — the last widget in the UI AC set).

- **New in `@retro-engine/ui`:** `UiImage` component (reflection-registered: image `Handle<Image>` +
  `tint` + source `uv` rect) + a screen-space textured render path mirroring the MSDF text pipeline —
  `UiImagePipeline` (per-texture bind-group cache), `prepareUiImages` (batch by texture), and a
  `makeUiImagePassNode` pass wired into `UiRenderPlugin` ordered quad → **image** → text. A node can
  carry both a `backgroundColor` and a `UiImage`.
- **Verified end-to-end in a real browser** (`apps/sample-game` export → Playwright): added a 4th `.rss`
  chip (`.chip.pic`) whose fill is a `UiImage` of a 2×2 procedural magenta/cyan checkerboard
  (`Image.fromBytes` → `Images.add`). Probe read `__rss.imageInstances === 1` (the textured pipeline
  packed + drew exactly one image) and the pic chip laid out at the strip's 4th slot — a solid-color quad
  cannot produce a sampled texture, so this proves real texture sampling. Screenshot captured.
- **Automated:** `packUiImage` test in `ui-render.test.ts` + `ui-image-pack` bench. Full repo gate green
  (1941 tests). Changeset added.
- **HOW to test:** `cd apps/sample-game && bun run build:web`, serve `dist/web`, open in a browser → the
  top-left chip strip's 4th chip shows a magenta/cyan checker (the others are solid blue/orange/blue).
- Docs: `roadmap/ui-system.md` (image widget ✅), MASTER-ROADMAP UI AC (`image` ✅). **The UI P0 item now
  has only ONE AC gap left: `.rss` inheritance** (cascade ✅, inheritance ❌).

## BLOCKED (this session) — studio MCP relay down

- **Play-mode "inspector shows live values during play"** (the last Play-mode AC item) could NOT be
  MCP-verified this session: the `retro-studio` MCP server/relay is disconnected (nothing on ws://…:8787,
  `studio_connected`/ToolSearch find no tools), and `bun tauri dev` has no relay to connect to. **Code
  inspection says it's already satisfied:** `panels-inspector.ts` re-reads each field fresh every frame via
  `readField(instance, …)` and passes `readonly: state.playing` — so during play the inspector shows the
  live (mutating) component values, just non-editable. If you can confirm in the studio (select an entity
  with a changing gameplay value, press Play, watch the inspector update), Play mode's AC is fully met
  (snapshot ✅ / step ✅ / gating ✅ / inspector-live ✅) and its box + backlog can close.
- If the relay needs restarting: it's the `retro-studio` MCP server (`.mcp.json`:
  `bun run packages/studio-mcp-server/src/cli.ts`) — a session-level MCP connection the harness owns.
